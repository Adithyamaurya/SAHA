**Saha** is a personal indie project lab where ideas meet code. Itâ€™s a creative space to explore, learn, and build full-stack productsâ€”from scratch to ship.

## ğŸ§  What is Saha?
Saha is where I:
- Build experimental tools and web products
- Learn in public through real-world projects
- Explore the intersection of code, design, and automation

- This only frontend part of project
  

## ğŸ›  Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: PostgreSQL / Firebase (based on project)
